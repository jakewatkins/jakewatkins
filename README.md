# Jake Watkins

Welcome to my corner of the hub.  I'm a software developer who has been building solutions for 30 years (or so, I've sorta lost count).
I have a YouTube channel were I post videos about whatever I want.  You can find it here: [my channel](https://www.youtube.com/@jake-watkins)

## 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
My focus right now is on AI & ML engineering.  
I don't think AI is going to replace developers, but it is going to change how we get things done.  I think this is really exciting and is going to great some mind blowing opportunities for a lot of people.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on ...
I've decided to focus my efforts on building on Apple Silicon.  Instead of investing in NVIDIA hardware, I'm just using what I already have and plan to buy more of.
I've already gotten in to Apple's MLX framework which lets me run LLMs using Apple's GPUs.  I started looking into their CoreML framework, but have stopped for now because it doesnt appear to do what I want.  I'll explore it more after I finish my current project: build out an agentic host.  

## ⚡ Favorite projects

Right now I have two.  First is [Bones](https://github.com/jakewatkins/bones) which is a simple utility that sets up projects with resources I regularly use.  For example I have an editor config file and a gitignore file that I have been copying project to project.  It also deploys my GitHub Copilot prompts and will setup spec kit for your project as well.  All of the prompts and other files come from a separate repo: [copilot-resources](https://github.com/jakewatkins/copilot-resources).

The next project is [mlxlab](https://github.com/jakewatkins/mlxlab) which contains the projects I've created as I've learned python and how to work with Apple's MLX library.  My favorite project in there is llm-cli which lets you run any HuggingFace model on your Mac from the command line.  It is also an MCP client so you can configure MCP Servers and they'll be made available to the LLM.  This was a blast to develop.
